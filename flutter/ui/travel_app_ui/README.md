# travel_app_ui

A ui focused project to get practice creating ui with Flutter.

I followed a mock up implement this UI. Here is the link to the design:

Some thoughts:

- I used base widgets almost entirely, some on purpose, and some because I may not have known about existing widgets.
- I split up widgets a lot and separated to different files/folders. Not sure if I like this.
